Certainly! Here's a table summarizing the commonly used CSS pseudo-element selectors:

| Pseudo-Element Selector | Description |
|-------------------------|-------------|
| `::before`              | Inserts content before the selected element. |
| `::after`               | Inserts content after the selected element. |
| `::first-line`          | Selects the first line of the selected element's content. |
| `::first-letter`        | Selects the first letter of the selected element's content. |
| `::selection`           | Selects a portion of the selected element's content that has been highlighted by the user. |
| `::placeholder`         | Selects the placeholder text in an input or textarea element. |
| `::marker`              | Selects the marker of a list item. |
| `::backdrop`            | Represents the background behind an element that is being presented in full-screen or immersive mode. |
| `::cue`                 | Selects the parts of an HTML media element's cue content that is being displayed. |
| `::spelling-error`      | Selects a misspelled word in an editable element. |
| `::grammar-error`       | Selects a grammatically incorrect word in an editable element. |

These pseudo-elements provide additional ways to manipulate and style specific parts of elements or add content before or after elements using CSS. It's worth noting that some pseudo-elements have double colons (::) while others still support the single colon notation (:), and it's recommended to use double colons (::) for future compatibility.
