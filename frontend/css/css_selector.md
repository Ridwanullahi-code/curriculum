A CSS selector is a pattern used to select and target specific elements on a web page for styling or manipulation using CSS (Cascading Style Sheets). Here are some commonly used CSS selectors:

1. Element selector: Targets elements based on their tag name. Example: `p` selects all `<p>` elements.

2. Class selector: Targets elements based on their class attribute. Example: `.my-class` selects all elements with `class="my-class"`.

3. ID selector: Targets elements based on their ID attribute. Example: `#my-id` selects the element with `id="my-id"`.

4. Attribute selector: Targets elements based on their attribute values. Example: `[type="text"]` selects all elements with `type="text"`.

5. Descendant selector: Targets elements that are descendants of another element. Example: `ul li` selects all `<li>` elements that are inside a `<ul>` element.

6. Child selector: Targets elements that are direct children of another element. Example: `ul > li` selects all `<li>` elements that are immediate children of a `<ul>` element.

7. Adjacent sibling selector: Targets an element that immediately follows another element. Example: `h2 + p` selects the `<p>` element that directly follows an `<h2>` element.

8. Pseudo-classes and pseudo-elements: Selectors that target specific states or parts of elements. Example: `:hover` selects an element when the mouse pointer is over it.

These are just a few examples of CSS selectors. There are many more available, and you can combine them to create complex and specific selectors to target elements on your web page.
