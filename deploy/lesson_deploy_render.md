# Deployment with Render

## Learning objectives

- Use Render to deploy web applications.

### Estimated time: 1h

## Description

In this lesson, you will learn how to deploy web applications using [Render](https://render.com/). Thanks to that your app will be available online and... you will be able to just send its link to your friends, so they can check what you are able to build!

### Render

As your websites become more complex, you'll turn your websites into web applications. To support these bigger deployments, you'll start using a new platform called [Render](https://render.com/). It will allow you to deploy:

- Static sites (i.e. HTML, CSS & JavaScript web pages)
- Web Services (i.e. Rails applications)
- Databases (i.e. PostgreSQL)
