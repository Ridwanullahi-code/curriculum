# What is software deployment?

The term `deployment` has many meanings. In a general sense, it refers to _putting someone or something into action._

In the world of software engineering the term has a slightly different meaning: _itâ€™s the act of making software available to its end users._

This usually means:

- Putting your codebase on a **server**,
- which is connected to the **internet**,
- and exposes a **URL,**
- that can be accessed through a **browser**.

### Different terms, same meaning

In the real world you might hear different terms referring to the same thing. For example, software deployment is also known as **code deployment**, **application deployment**, **going live** and **pushing to production**.

### Production environment

When software is deployed, the published version is hosted in a `production environment`: a setting where all the necessary resources (i.e. database, runtime, etc.) are available in order for the software to work optimally and it can be used by end users.
