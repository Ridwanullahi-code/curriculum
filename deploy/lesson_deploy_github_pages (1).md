# Deployment with GitHub Pages

## Learning objectives

- Use GitHub Pages to deploy web pages.

### Estimated time: 1h

## Description

In this lesson, you will learn how to deploy a simple website using [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/). Thanks to that your app will be available online and... you will be able to just send its link to your friends, so they can check what you are able to build!

### GitHub Pages

During the Microverse program you will learn about different deployment tools. In this lesson we will start with GitHub Pages, a simple but powerful way to deploy your application. Its main advantages are:

- It's free
- It's easy and fast to start
- It's totally integrated with GitHub
- Works perfectly with small and static applications
- It has integration with a lot of tools
