# Pair programming: how to do it well

## Learning objectives
- Demonstrate the ability to work as a navigator while pair programming.
- Demonstrate the ability to work as a driver while pair programming.

### Estimated time: 1.5h

## Description

Pair programming is a technique that involves two people working together to solve the same programming problem. In pair programming both partners work on the same piece of code  at the same time in a synchronous way.
Pair programming is one of the elements of the *Extreme Programming* software development methodology. Extreme Programming emphasizes improving software quality and responsiveness to changing customer requirements.
You have already tried pair programming during the admission trials. Now it is time to reflect more on how your first pair programming experience went and get ready to practice pair programming throughout the entire Microverse program.

### Why is it important?

Basically, two heads are better than one. Thanks to pair programming you can learn more, you can create better code, and you can improve your communication skills.
Efficiently doing pair programming might be challenging though, as you'll see in the reading materials. That's why we ask you to practice it at Microverse, so that you can become comfortable with the process before a future employer asks you to try this approach.

If pair-programming or the collaboration with your partner is not going as expected, please reach out to Student Success right away so we can help solve the problem. This might be due to your partner not showing up, your partner not following the driver or navigator role, your partner not having a good internet connection, etc. In some cases, we will re-pair you, in other's we will try and resolve the issue. In all cases, it's better to reach out to Student Success right away so that any challenge with pair-programming does not result in a repeat week.

### Get ready for better pair programming

- As a refresher, read the [How remote pair programming works & why it can change your life](https://www.microverse.org/blog/how-remote-pair-programming-works-and-why-it-can-change-your-life).
- Watch this 17 minute long presentation [To pair or not to pair: pair programming](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_eZ-ae2FY8) from 
ThoughtWorks.
- Read about [Pair-programming at Microverse](https://microverse.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360046209594-How-do-I-Pair-Program-at-Microverse-) to learn the guidelines for pair programming that you will be following while learning at Microverse.
- Watch this example session of pair programming carefully!
     - [![example session of pair programming](https://img.youtube.com/vi/PAh4NSj5jgs/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAh4NSj5jgs)

- Finish by reading [The power of pair programming lies in the execution](https://medium.com/free-code-camp/the-power-of-pair-programming-lies-on-the-execution-a27938447994) to get yourself in the correct mindset about pair programming.

## Challenge yourself

*Use these optional questions to check what you learned during this lesson.* 

- How is the navigator role different from the driver?
- How often should you change roles while pair programming?
- Can I divide tasks between me and my partner tasks, work on them separately from my partner, and still call it pair programming?

## Additional materials
**These are all optional, but if you're interested in exploring this topic further, here are some resources to help you. Any exploration here should be done outside program time.**
- Read about [Extreme Programming (XP)](https://www.agilealliance.org/glossary/xp/#q=~(infinite~false~filters~(postType~(~'post~'aa_book~'aa_event_session~'aa_experience_report~'aa_glossary~'aa_research_paper~'aa_video)~tags~(~'xp))~searchTerm~'~sort~false~sortDirection~'asc~page~1)).
