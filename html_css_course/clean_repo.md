## Description

Apply all of the basic rules in each of your GitHub repositories and remember about the most important rule:  you should always think about the other people that work on your code. Throughout the entire Microverse program you will complete many projects, and you will use GitHub repositories to store them. It is important to keep your GitHub repositories looking professional for all projects.
**At Microverse if you request a review for a GitHub repository that is not professional, it will be marked as invalid. This will help you develop the good habit of documenting your projects.**

### Why is it important?

You should always make sure your repo looks professional. This is one of the first things that hiring managers or your potential colleagues will check when considering you for a position on their team. Your GitHub account is the equivalent of your LinkedIn profile in the software developer world.

### How to make sure that your repo is professional

We prepared a few simple rules that you should follow to make sure that your repo is professional. Read the ["Professional repo - basic rules"](https://github.com/microverseinc/curriculum-transversal-skills/blob/main/documentation/articles/professional_repo_rules.md) article carefully!
